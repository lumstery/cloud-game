currently my cloud gaming solution is focused on simulating gameboy experience where there is screen in the center and buttons on sides like joystic, I want to change UI to simulate mobile phone from 2000 with UI that simulates hardware buttons , you can do something that was in NOkia, but do not use nokia word , all buttons should work properly , It should always be fixed vertical, remove anything that is related to screen orientation. As a result I want to be able to open my site from modern iphone/android browsers and see on screen phone with hardware buttons shown on the screen and screen where our j2me game will be shown, for now set image resolution to 240 x 320 for simplicity , but in future screen should be adaptive to the resolution that certain j2me game demands. You can remove features like multi player , player choice. Everything should be simplified to the way that we will have either ability to choose j2me game and play, or import it from file and play as well. Make thorough analysis before applying changes.
